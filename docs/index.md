# Campus Contributor Documentation

These pages are intended for current and potential campus contributors to the
Open Science Data Federation (OSDF) and
Open Science Pool (OSPool),
including cluster administrators,
project PIs and leadership, and
campus staff who facilitate the use of clusters.

Please [let us know](mailto:support@osg-htc.org)
how we can improve these pages to better support you!


## Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)

The Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)
connects disparate dataset repositories into
a single, nationwide data distribution network.

At this time, information about contributing to the OSDF is located
[on our main OSDF webpage](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf).


## Open Science Pool (OSPool)

The [Open Science Pool](https://osg-htc.org/services/ospool/) (OSPool)
presents a unified means of accessing
computing capacity that is shared from campuses nationwide
via a single HTCondor pool.
This pool is accessible to any researcher affiliated with a US academic institution.
