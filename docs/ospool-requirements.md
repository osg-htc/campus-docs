# OSPool Contribution Requirements

## Contributing via a Hosted CE

### The cluster and login node are set up for our user account

-   The cluster is operational and generally works
-   The user account has a home directory on the login node
-   The user account can read, write, and execute files and directories within its home directory
-   Our home directory has enough available space and inodes (TBD but not a lot)
-   PATH staff know the right partition (and other batch system config) to use
-   The batch system is configured to allow the user account to submit jobs to the right partition(s) and for the default job “shape” (e.g., 1 core, 2 GB memory, and 24-hour maximum run time)
    
### It is possible to SSH from the CE to the login node:

-   PATh staff know the current hostname of your login node
-   That hostname has a public DNS entry that resolves to the correct IP address
-   PATh staff know the user account name (default, “osg01”)
-   PATh staff know about SSH configuration details to use (e.g., alternate port, jump host)
-   The SSH client on one of our IP addresses can connect to your login node (through firewalls, etc.)
-   The provided SSH public key has been installed in the right place and with the right permissions
-   The provided SSH public key is sufficient for authentication by your SSH server

### The worker nodes on which our jobs may run are ready:

-   Our home directory is shared with each cluster node
-   PATh staff know the correct path to scratch space for jobs (ideally on each worker node, but a shared filesystem may work)
-   Our user account can create subdirectories and run executables in the scratch directory
-   The worker nodes have permissive outbound network connectivity to the Internet (default allow, please note specific restrictions)
